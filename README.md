Today I spent my time learning how to work with React Native, which is the langauge I'll be creating my Snö app with.

One of the videos I use to study this can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSRrxpdMpVc



Name of Student: 

Adam Mansell

Name of Project: 

Snö



Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)

Snö is where snowboarders and skiers can go to check out daily snowfall/weather information pertaining to their local mountain, along with alerts about any possible avalanche warnings.



List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

Connecting a weather API to get Mt.Hood's weather forecast
Having a view page that shows snowfall (alone and not alongside other weather info)
Having separate info sections for Mt.Hood Meadows and Timberline

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

React-Redux
Weather API to show Snow Conditions at Mt.Hood

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

Adding other locations besides Mt.Hood, possibly outside of Oregon
Adding possible Avalanche warnings
Adding a login feature where you can login and save certain mountains as your "Home Mountains"

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

Will require another API or possibly more than 2

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

Going to see if I can make this a mobile app! If not I'll make it a site.
